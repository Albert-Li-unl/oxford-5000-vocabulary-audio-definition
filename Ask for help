The vocabulary list you crafted has proven to be incredibly beneficial for me. 
Currently, I am utilizing the oxford_3000_by_cefr.pdf, oxford_5000_by_cefr.pdf, and oxford_5000_exclusive_by_cefr.pdf files as valuable resources to refine and enhance my vocabulary.

However, I discovered one potential area for improvement. 
For a well-rounded learning experience, it's crucial to explore multiple meanings of words, especially considering that some words have multiple key definitions (represented by key icons). 
Take the preposition "about" as an example; it contains two key meanings at the A1 and B1 levels. .
Specifically, it would be useful to expand all key definitions for each word and introduce a second meaning for words that only have one key meaning. 
I would invest money to get a word list like this.
